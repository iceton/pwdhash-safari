## Generate a password

Click a password input and press <kbd>F2</kbd> or <kbd>@</kbd> <kbd>@</kbd> before typing your password. When the input's background is green, your password will be hashed.

(PwdHash hashes are often 2 characters longer than your original password. You can usually see the hash being substituted when the cursor leaves the password input.)

## What's PwdHash?

### PwdHash generates site-specific passwords

PwdHash hashes the password you type with the site's domain name. For example, typing `password` into a site on a `google.com` domain will generate `GEGW8EGRbW`.

### Which means you can use one password everywhere

Remember one simple password, which PwdHash turns into an unintelligible string of letters, numbers, and special characters unique to each site.
